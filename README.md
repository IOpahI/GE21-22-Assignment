Student Number: C19518983

Class Group: Game Design

# Description of the project

The idea for this project is to create a representation of a vaporwave style of audio visualisation. This will include RGB, neon textures, and a procedural terrain, as well as a number of different songs. In addition there will be bright particles to fill the screen to ensure that the project doesnt feel too empty.

Visual Aspects

- Frequency-line responding to the music along the horizon
- Particles, to please the eye
- a bobbing effect, given by the terrain


Interactive Aspects

- A button/key to change song
- Buttons and sliders to interact with the visuals

# Instructions for use

- Use mouse to drag sliders, and to use toggles and dropdown bar

# How it works
